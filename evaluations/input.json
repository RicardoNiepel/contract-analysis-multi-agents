While 123\r\nLogistics will consider the Union's input in good faith, it retains the final and exclusive authority\r\nto make all decisions regarding subcontracting, provided such decisions are not arbitrary or\r\ncapricious.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Article 5: Subordinate to Statutes\/Savings Clau\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABCContract\nABC Contract\r\nCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nby and between\r\nABC Transit\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nLocal Union No. 789, Teamsters\r\n\r\nCovering\r\n\r\nMechanics, Equipment Body Repair, Fuelers, Washer\/Cleaners, Equipment Service Workers,\r\nFacilities Maintenance Workers, and Facilities Support Specialists\r\n\r\nJune 1, 2024, through May 31, 2027\r\n\r\n\r\n# Preamble\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is established between ABC Transit, herein referred to as \"ABC\" or \"Employer,\" and\r\nTeamsters Local 789, herein referred to as \"Union.\"\r\n\r\nPer the stipulations of RCW 41.56, the Public Employees' Collective Bargaining Act, and its\r\ncorresponding regulations, and in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the parties\r\nhereby agree to the following:\r\n\r\nThe parties acknowledge their shared interest in the effective operation of ABC, and recognize that\r\nfostering cooperation between labor and management will advance their collective goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Article 1: Recognition\r\n\r\n1\\. 1 The Employer formally recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive representative for\r\ncollective bargaining purposes for employees in the classifications of Mechanics, Equipment Body\r\nRepair Worker, Vehicle Service Worker, Equipment Service Worker, Facilities Maintenance Worker,\r\nand Facilities Support Specialist.\r\n\r\n2\\. 2 The bargaining unit subject to this Agreement encompasses all regular full-time and regular part-\r\ntime employees (those working less than twenty-four (24) hours per week) within the classifications of\r\nMechanics, Equipment Body Repair Worker, Vehicle Service Worker, Equipment Service Worker,\r\nFacilities\r\n\r\nMaintenance Worker, and Facilities Support Specialist.\r\n\r\n3\\. 3 Employees excluded from this bargaining unit and thus not covered by this agreement include\r\nmanagement personnel, supervisors, clerical staff, parts personnel, temporary employees (not\r\nexceeding forty-five (45) days), and all other employees of the Employer.\r\n\r\n<!-- PageBreak -->\r\n\r\n4\\. 4 All elected officials and officers of the Employer are excluded from the bargaining unit, as\r\ncertified by PERC Case No. 9876-A-24-2468.\r\n\r\n5\\. 5 The Union acknowledges that the Employer's management personnel retain the right to perform\r\nany and all types of work carried out by bargaining unit members on a temporary or emergency basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Article 2: Management Rights\r\n\r\n6\\. 1 The Union acknowledges that the Employer has the right to manage and direct its operations in all\r\nrespects, in accordance with its legal responsibilities, powers, and authority.\r\n\r\n7\\. 2 Any matters not specifically and explicitly addressed or governed by the language of this\r\nAgreement shall be administered by the Employer for the duration of this Agreement, according to\r\nsuch policies and\/or procedures as the Employer may establish from time to time.\r\n\r\n8\\. 3 The Employer's rights include, but are not limited to, the following: a.

Each posting will\r\ninclude a written job description, required qualifications, and the relevant wage and step for the\r\nposition. Employees must submit a letter of interest and a current resume within seven (7) calendar\r\ndays to be considered.\r\n\r\n38\\. 2 Advancement: Employees may be advanced to a higher job classification even if there is no\r\nopen position. Advancements are based on an employee's demonstrated ability to perform the duties\r\nof the higher classification, management discretion, and input from peers.\r\n\r\n39\\. 3 Training\/Advancement Program: Following the ratification and execution of this Collective\r\nBargaining Agreement (CBA) in 2024, a joint committee with equal representation from the Union and\r\nManagement will be formed to develop and implement a training\/advancement program. If necessary,\r\na mutually agreed-upon third party may assist in the program's development. The committee will\r\nmeet at least twice a month until the program is completed.

The Employer has the right to determine: a) The\r\nnumber of positions per classification for each starting time and shift, and b) The starting times, in\r\naccordance with Article 8. Seniority for bidding purposes will be based on the length of employment\r\nin the department from the most recent hire date. The Employer retains the right to set starting times\r\nas per this Agreement. It is understood that training schedules may require temporary shift re-\r\nassignments. If the Employer introduces a new shift, notice will be provided according to Article 8,\r\nand bidding for the new starting times will follow the above procedures.\r\n\r\n<!-- PageBreak -->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Article 12: Wages\r\n\r\n41\\. 1 Employee wages are detailed in the classification and wage schedule in Appendix \"A,\" which is\r\nattached to and forms part of this Agreement.\r\n"

The CSD is calculated as the Hire\r\nDate, adjusted by adding days for specific qualifying reasons. For example, if the Hire Date is June 2,\r\n1986, and a 10-day adjustment is applied, the CSD becomes June 12, 1986.\r\n\r\n31\\. 2 Hire Date: The Hire Date is defined as the date an employee begins performing the regular duties\r\nof their assigned position.\r\n\r\n32\\. 3 Adjustments to the CSD will be made on a day-for-day basis for the following:\r\n\r\na) Leave of absence without pay exceeding forty-five (45) calendar days; and\/or\r\n\r\nb) Medical disability lasting longer than twenty-six (26) consecutive weeks; and\/or\r\n\r\nc) Time spent on layoff status.\r\n\r\n33\\. 4 An employee's CSD will be forfeited, and a new CSD established, if they are rehired after any of\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\na) Voluntary resignation;\r\n\r\nb) Termination for just cause;\r\n\r\nc) Retirement;\r\n\r\nd) Layoff lasting longer than one (1) year.\r\n\r\n34\\. 5 Anniversary Date: The Anniversary Date is calculated from the CSD.

However, Tech Innovations\r\nretains the right to contract out work that: a) has been historically and consistently contracted out prior to\r\nthe effective date of this agreement, or b) requires specialized expertise, equipment, or technology that is\r\nnot readily available within the bargaining unit and cannot be reasonably acquired by Tech Innovations.\r\n\r\n16\\. 2 Should circumstances necessitate the contracting out of work typically performed by the bargaining\r\nunit, Tech Innovations will provide the Union with reasonable notice and an opportunity to discuss the\r\npotential impact of such contracting on bargaining unit employees. While Tech Innovations will consider\r\nthe Union's input in good faith, it retains the final and exclusive authority to make all decisions regarding\r\nsubcontracting, provided such decisions are not arbitrary or capricious.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Article 5: Subordinate to Statutes\/Savings Clause\r\n\r\n17\\. 1 This Agreement is subject and subordinate to the statutes of the State of Washington and\r\nFederal statutory law, wherever applicable.

Overtime will be offered based on seniority,\r\nfollowing a rotating system. The most senior employee will have the first opportunity to work up to\r\neight hours of scheduled overtime before being placed at the bottom of the overtime eligibility list. A\r\nsign-up sheet for scheduled overtime will be posted every Monday. b. ABC will maintain the list of\r\nemployees eligible for scheduled overtime. c. Management will determine the necessary job\r\nclassification for the overtime work. d. If an employee is required to work scheduled overtime on a\r\ndifferent shift, that employee, if qualified, will be placed at the top of the scheduled overtime\r\neligibility list. Employees must have an 8-hour rest period both before and after their regular shift to\r\nbe eligible for scheduled overtime. e. Overtime may be assigned to ensure continuity of a specific job.\r\nThese overtime hours will be included in the calculation for the overtime eligibility list. f. If all\r\nemployees decline overtime, the least senior employees will be required to work it. Employees in their\r\nprobationary period with less than 400 hours are exempt from mandatory overtime. g. Failure to report\r\nfor scheduled overtime may result in disciplinary action for an unexcused absence, as per Article 20.\r\n\r\n26\\. 3 The Employer retains the right to adjust employees' regular working hours for operational\r\nefficiency and public convenience. Affected employees will receive a minimum of seven (7) working\r\ndays' notice of any changes to their regular working hours, except in emergency situations, where\r\nnotice will be provided as soon as reasonably possible.\r\n\r\n27\\. 4 Employees who have completed their regular shift and are called back to work will receive a\r\nminimum of three (3) hours of pay at the applicable rate.\r\n\r\n28\\. 5 Shift Starting Times\r\n\r\nNormal shift starting times are as follows:\r\n\r\n| Shift One | 05:00 am | to 11:59 am | (Day Shift) |\r\n:\r\n\r\n1:\r\n|:\r\n1:\r\n\r\n:\r\nShift Two | 12:00 noon | to 06:59 pm | (Swing Shift) |\r\n\r\n| Shift Three | 07:00 pm | to 04:59 am | (Graveyard) |\r\n\r\n81\\. 6 Shift Differential:\r\n\r\nEmployees will receive shift differential pay for all hours worked, based on their shift's starting time:\r\n| Shift One | No shift differential |\r\n\r\n:\r\n|:\r\n\r\n| Shift Two | ** 60 cents ** per hour |\r\n\r\n| Shift Three | ** \\\\$1.25 ** per hour |\r\n\r\n29\\. 7 Breaks: Employees are entitled to a fifteen (15) minute paid rest break during both the first and\r\nsecond four-hour work periods. Additionally, employees are allowed ten (10) minutes of paid clean-up\r\ntime per shift, as work demands permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Article 9: Continuity of Service\r\n\r\n30\\. 1 Continuity of Service: An employee's Continuity of Service Date (CSD) is used to determine\r\nbenefits tied to length of service and does not affect seniority rights. The CSD is calculated as the Hire\r\nDate, adjusted by adding days for specific qualifying reasons. For example, if the Hire Date is June 2,\r\n1986, and a 10-day adjustment is applied, the CSD becomes June 12, 1986.\r\n\r\n31\\. 2 Hire Date: The Hire Date is defined as the date an employee begins performing the regular duties\r\nof their assigned position.\r\n\r\n32\\. 3 Adjustments to the CSD will be made on a day-for-day basis for the following:\r\n\r\na) Leave of absence without pay exceeding forty-five (45) calendar days; and\/or\r\n\r\nb) Medical disability lasting longer than twenty-six (26) consecutive weeks; and\/or\r\n\r\nc) Time spent on layoff status.\r\n\r\n33\\. 4 An employee's CSD will be forfeited, and a new CSD established, if they are rehired after any of\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\na) Voluntary resignation;\r\n\r\nb) Termination for just cause;\r\n\r\nc) Retirement;\r\n\r\nd) Layoff lasting longer than one (1) year.\r\n\r\n34\\. 5 Anniversary Date: The Anniversary Date is calculated from the CSD.
